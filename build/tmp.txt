the command "/vis/open" or "/vis/sceneHandler/create",
or you may omit the driver parameter and choose at run time:
- by argument in the construction of G4VisExecutive;
- by environment variable "G4VIS_DEFAULT_DRIVER";
- by entry in "~/.g4session";
- by build flags.
- Note: This feature is not allowed in batch mode.
